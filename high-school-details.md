(We will have to differentiate between classes that span two semesters as opposed to one.)

(Also, while it may be redundant, we should list college classes that we took.)

(Adding grades may be desirable in the future. Full transcript grades are likely available in Oregon.)

## High school GPA

(Nothing here yet.)

(Need to have weighted/unweighted for Oregon and weighted/unweighted for UC system; also, for each of these we need perspective of end of junior-to-senior summer and end of senior semester one and end of senior semester two.)

## College applications

(Nothing here yet.)

(We mainly applied only to UC system and three schools within it -- UCB, UCLA, UCSD; also, we submitted an incomplete application to MIT. We did this because we made an honor code breach for senior-year AP English Literature that we later decided to drop; the UC system does not require recommendation from counselor, which would have contained a note about the honor code breach. We also applied to City-Year for either Boston or NYC and were scheduled to interview; I decided to avoid a gap year and continue to college directly instead.)

(Accepted to three UC schools.)

(Asked for recommendations from Walters and Bue.)

(Putting our college essays up here may not be desirable; we need to consider what to do with them.)

(Need to back up either college class of 2011 UC application that was due on Nov. 30th, 2006 if possible or UC application for some later year, assuming that a later application would be somewhat similar to the one that was due on Nov. 30th, 2006. We may do this via e.g. scrapbooking. This is somewhat time-sensitive.)
