## Class repair

There are classes from our course history that require repair work from us. There are *over-credited classes*, which means we earned credits for and finished a class but did not do as much work as we should have. There are *under-credited classes*, which means we did not earn credits for the class, but we did some work for it. We will use plant grafting terminology to talk about repair work for classes. We will mention course information documents, which we define as having course policies and e.g. grade break-down. Also, we will mention syllabus documents, which we define as having topic schedule (and not necessarily homework assignments or homework schedule). We assume there is a hierarchy of importance for documents related to a class; for our purposes, we will just say course-information/syllabus (CIS) document is most important. Then, we say that other documents such as exams or quizzes are relatively less important. We have two classes from a non-interrupted semester (i.e. Fall 2007) that we did not put in enough effort for (e.g. for quizzes, exams, participation in in-person discussions) that we call *repair-worthy over-credited*. One such class is a non-seminar and we do not lack CIS document for but lack secondary original documents for that we call *repair-worthy over-credited non-seminar*. One other such class is a seminar that we possibly lack CIS document for as well as possibly some secondary original documents that we call *repair-worthy over-credited seminar*; lacking an original CIS document for that class we treat as acceptable given that since the class is a seminar that is pass/fail it has relatively predictable grading policy (which we treat as one of the most important parts of a CIS document); we then decide that we can use e.g. a blank placeholder together with a custom original course description as replacement for such a class's CIS document. Then, we have two semesters (i.e. Spring 2008 and Fall 2009) which we interrupted via personal withdrawal; we call these classes *repair-worthy under-credited*. We arbitrarily decide we wish to have a partial CIS document at least for each class from these semesters. Those classes which we do not have such a document for we consider to be *repair-worthy under-credited un-stocked*. The classes which we do have such a document for we consider to be *repair-worthy under-credited stocked*.

### General responses

#### Repair-worthy class responses

1. Repair-worthy over-credited non-seminar (RON) ![RON](placeholders/red.png)

   We assume we have at least partial CIS document and substitute in missing secondary materials using those for other offerings of same class. We treat these substitute documents as scion and graft onto stock of original CIS document. An important detail is that with RON classes we end up with a complete class.

2. Repair-worthy over-credited seminar (ROS) ![ROS](placeholders/blue.png)

   We use blank placeholder and course description in place of missing original CIS document. We are okay with missing original stock.

3. Repair-worthy under-credited un-stocked (RUU) ![RUU](placeholders/green.png)

   We substitute in CIS document from another offering of same class and treat as stock. Then, we use secondary documents from the original class and graft them on possibly after modulating it to make sure it is at least as hard as counterpart documents from class we take CIS document from; we may also be missing secondary documents and we find substitutes for those from other offerings of the class as well, treat them as scion and graft them onto replacement CIS document we use as stock. As with RON case, an important detail is that with RUU classes we end up with a complete class. Even if some materials from original class are not graded, we want to make sure we have at least almost-equivalent documents available, as well.

4. Repair-worthy under-credited stocked (RUS) ![RUS](placeholders/yellow.png)

   We are okay with having only solely original possibly partial CIS document, which serves as stock.

#### Miscellaneous general tactics

It is important that when we deal with repair-worthy classes, we attempt to not drop and waste any of the original documents from a course that we may have, even if our original document collection for a class may be partially incomplete. This is especially the case for RUU case given that we start by assuming we replace the unusually important CIS document stock with that of another offering of the course. Then, if we additionally use e.g. only the secondary documents from that of other offering, this means we do not stand enough to gain if we assume that part of the point is to internalize the idiosyncrasies of a class taught in a specific semester by a specific professor. Otherwise, we say that we repair by using a *complete replacement*. We note that there is motivation to start from a different CIS document because if we have no e.g. original grade break-down details, which we treat as unusually important, then we have no basis on which to decide a secondary document (original or substitute) that we decide to use is suitable enough (which involves considering if the document interacts well with others that we choose). This happens at least one time for an under-credited class we consider, as pleasant as it would be to be able to always assume we can start based on some partial CIS document that may lack grade break-down.

Also, for cases RON and RUU, we wish to be able to get a grade from the post-repair class.

Additionally, it is important that one of the points for over-credited courses is that we are able to make up for missed material, even if I received credit for the class. Part of this involves our adding as little extra work or overhead as possible and involves ideally a clean swap-out for any original details I now lack. For example, if a class had two midterms and a final and I missed a second midterm and I don't have access to that midterm at this moment in time, I would prefer a replacement midterm from a class that also had two midterms and a final (as opposed to e.g. three midterms and a final).

It is important that for exams and quizzes we have scoring systems. It is somewhat less realistic that we have access to scoring systems for quizzes. When we do not have scoring systems, we can assume that questions at same level for the same exam or quiz are equally weighted. It, however, may turn out that we have adequate scoring systems for exams and quizzes s.t. they each are a *shallow scoring system*, which means we have high-level scoring system but we lack official details about how to assign partial credit to answers given to problems.

We will most likely be lax about grading for homework, labs, and worksheets.

#### Specific class groups

1. Fall 2007 Physics 24 -- ROS ![ROS](placeholders/blue.png)

   We use blank placeholder together with custom original course description instead of missing original CIS document. We have done enough remedial work on basis of archived emails associated with bSpace messages that mention discussion topics.

2. Fall 2007 Math 1A -- RON ![RON](placeholders/red.png)

   Use Hald/Agol/Shin/Haiman (HASH).

   Hald -- Fall 2007  
   Agol -- Fall 2008, Fall 2011  
   Shin -- Fall 2017  
   Haiman -- Fall 2010

   We use partial CIS document from Hald Fall 2007. We use quizzes from two Agol semesters -- Agol Fall 2008 and Agol Fall 2011. (However, we more greatly prefer to use quizzes from Agol Fall 2008 because they have shallow scoring system as opposed to no scoring system whatsoever.) We use two midterms and a final from Shin Fall 2017. We use three midterms and a final from Haiman Fall 2010. We most likely missed midterm #2 from Hald Fall 2007 when taking the class in person, so we wish to make up for it using a midterm #2 from a class that also has two midterms and one final as opposed to three midterms and a final; this means that when it comes to choosing between Haiman Fall 2010 and Shin Fall 2017 for main source for midterms and final, we choose the latter. Also, Shin Fall 2017 has shallow scoring systems for their exams. We use twelve quizzes from Agol Fall 2008 via TA Bradley Froehle and nine quizzes from Agol Fall 2011 via TA Aaron Mazel-Gee. (This respects a detail from Hald saying TA's handle quiz amounts and problems s.t. there are at most twelve quizzes.) Midterm, final, quiz substitutes are justified given weights for substitutes are higher than or match those for counterpart documents for original course. The substitutes we use also are present in blank and solved forms. We're assuming subjects for midterms are disjoint and final is cumulative. We're also assuming the reader we use is suitable as substitute for original reader. (We note that this reader assumption is less risky given the reader from Hald was not used for grade.) Attention must be paid to which textbooks are used. Of course, we have CIS documents for the classes we take materials to serve as substitutes from (i.e. all except Hald Fall 2007, even though we have it for that class as well).

3. Fall 2009 Physics 7B -- RUU ![RUU](placeholders/green.png)

   Use Zettl/Lee/Bordel (ZLB).

   Zettl -- Spring 2008  
   Lee -- Fall 2009  
   Bordel -- Spring 2015

   We use CIS document from Zettl Spring 2008. We use two midterms each from Lee Fall 2009 and from Zettl Spring 2008 (noting that we will talk about how to combine them to form midterm substitutes). We use final from Bordel Spring 2015. We're assuming workbook for Zettl Spring 2008 and Bordel Spring 2015 match a particular workbook we know was used for Lee Fall 2009; in particular, we're assuming Zettl Spring 2008 and Lee Fall 2009 do so that labs and worksheets are the same for those two semesters (noting that we seem to technically be able to avoid caring for Bordel Spring 2015, though knowing the workbook, labs, and worksheets for Bordel Spring 2015 are same w.r.t. these other two course offerings could unexpectedly prove to be minorly useful in the future). We're assuming subjects for midterms (from Lee and Bordel) are disjoint. (We know they are for Zettl Spring 2008). We include homeworks from Lee Fall 2009 and Zettl Spring 2008 (and combine them in a way we will talk about later) with the effect of roughly doubling the amount of homework assignments relative to what is assigned usually. We synthesize quizzes using problems from Giancoli; specifically, we use as quizzes the last problem in each section that has not been assigned by Zettl Spring 2008 or Lee Fall 2009. (This respects a snippet we have from Lee Fall 2009 describing how problems are chosen for quizzes. We will upload blank quizzes eventually. Also, the issue of having a scoring system for these quizzes is fine as they are self-synthesized anyway, meaning what we have as system may be our own choice.) The substitute exams we use are present in blank and solved forms. We know subjects for Lee Fall 2009 (via topic list document) and Bordel Spring 2015 (via email) finals are cumulative. Midterm and final substitutes are justified given weights for substitutes not coming from Lee Fall 2009 (because we lack grade breakdown for that class) are higher than or match those for class whose grade break-down we use as reference (i.e. Zettl Spring 2008). Of course, we have CIS documents for the classes we take materials to serve as substitutes from (i.e. all except Lee Fall 2009).

   It is important to note that we view our task of synthesizing quizzes as being for Zettl Spring 2008 Physics 7B (i.e. the class we take grade break-down from). We do this because while both classes we know that the policy is to choose questions from homework for quizzes, only for Zettl Spring 2008 (as opposed to for Lee Fall 2009) do we know that each quiz consists of exactly one question. There are five categories for activities for the Zettl Spring 2008 grade break-down: midterm #1, midterm #2, final, lab, quiz, homework. For midterms one and two, we take MIN of grades for those exams for Zettl Spring 2008 and Lee Fall 2009; we do this so that the hybrid test replacement is at least as hard as exam from only Zettl Spring 2008. (Also, this is assuming that luck is even across activities for the same category whose grades serve as operands for MIN.) We do similar MIN-ing to create hard-enough hybrid documents for homework (i.e. we choose as grade for homework as being MIN of grade for Lee Fall 2009 homework and Zettl Spring 2008 homework). We note again that Bordel Spring 2015 final weight is at least as much as for Zettl Spring 2008, which is good as we treat overall offerings for the same course as roughly interchangeable; this means that the Bordel Spring 2015 final corresponds to a large enough amount of absolute work. We have *pessimistic rhyming* s.t. we cannot synthesize quizzes for Lee Fall 2009 directly but are so close to be able to (because we know how to choose problems), but do not because we lack information about how many problems there are for each quiz; while we do not want to throw information from the original offering (i.e. Lee Fall 2009), we need to "round down" to be sure that the resulting post-repair class we have is in some sense coherent and is sufficiently difficult.

   We note that we likely have the instructions for one to be able to perform the labs for this replacement course. To actually perform the labs, we need equipment, however. This lack of equipment is specifically not an issue for us because we have done the labs before (assuming same workbook was used) in Fall 2010.

4. Spring 2008 Art Practice 98, Chem 3A, Chem 3AL, Math 1B, Physics 7A -- RUS ![RUS](placeholders/yellow.png)

   We have at-least-partial CIS documents for each of these courses.

5. Fall 2009 CS 70, Math 53 -- RUS ![RUS](placeholders/yellow.png)

   We have at-least-partial CIS documents for each of these courses.

#### Miscellaneous specific tactics

For RUU and RON, when we repair, we can also call the result a *Frankenstein class*; we give this name to such a class (that we also call a "complete replacement") partially because we combine materials that came from different offerings of the class and partially because we have a self-contained replacement plan (i.e. a finite and fixed amount of work), which also means we eventually we could arrive at a substitute grade if we finish the activities that we detail for the replacement. Some details may not know for sure, such as how much time we make available for quizzes. (Such non-resolved details are noted in the "sticky" section of this repair document.) We also mention that for Fall 2007 Math 1A, we may wish to use for acronym not HASH but HA, because we recently found a midterm two for Agol Fall 2008 Math 1A in blank form s.t. we now have all exams (in blank and solved forms) for that offering and that offering has two midterms (as opposed to e.g. three). A downside is that the blank form of midterm two has a cosmetic issue s.t. it says that it is a "sample" even though it is the correct exam in terms of content. (We know this because the solution document we have we know is correct and our blank form labeled "sample" likely has the same questions; we only "likely" know because we do not wish to examine the entire document in case we wish to use it later.) A bigger downside is that these exams for Agol Fall 2008 Math 1A we seem to not have even shallow scoring systems for.

### Conversation details

Math 1A  
* Prof. Hald -- asked many questions about nature of syllabus s.t. it is important we do not follow-up anymore; covered number of quizzes being <= 12 and different based on the TA, covered reader not being used for grade, covered exams not being retrievable, was told textbook version changes from semester to semester or from professor to professor; we assume midterms cover disjoint subjects and final is cumulative (s.t. this is a sticky and we also ask around -- e.g. to McCarty, Halpern-Leistner, Matic, Ventura, Kazi)
* TA's from Prof. Hald's lecture -- e.g. Dominic McCarty, who sent us a copy of partial CIS document; many responded; list is: Gupta, Kazi, Halpern-Leistner, Donatelli, Haletky, Liu, Ventura, Herbert, Trang, Dutter, Adiredja, McCarty -- also, head TA was Matic
* Students from Amit Gupta's two sections (34 people) -- some did respond and most did not; contact via email, Cal alumni network, Facebook, LinkedIn, web form; list is (s.t. number of people is 35): VA, ID, KL, SC, OG, TS, AD, JP, AW, RM, AV, SJ, JP, DS, HM, CL, VC, PN, VS, AH1, YJK, DY, BT, AG, RG, HV, GW, HJ, AH2, CD, CAP, BF, SF, MJ (noting that we are excluding people whose names we don't know but that we have email addresses for and we exclude people we have no contact information for at all); number of people we emailed but don't know name for is 3 (i.e. these people are jessicat, tjk000, nier), number of people we are unable to contact at all is 6 (i.e. these people are mzielinski, deepi905, lumpylustinlester, swergeles, dmlai, jhwkang), number of people we thought we knew names for but that we made mistake for is 2 (i.e. these people are bluebird722, dpaz); total is 34 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 45; need to tell SNS that we thought first name was sasha because of a flawed google search using "bluebird722" as the search term and page https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1680263/Na-viWolf -- i forgot that another link that showed up (i.e. https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1376446/BlueBird722) was valid but that these two webpages (while they are from same general website) are not necessarily related to each other -- i also note that the pages seem to not show up together as readily anymore via google, but i claim that they did used to -- additionally, i thought (incorrectly) that the "na-" part of the name matched up with last name of yours; also, i need to tell daniel pazo that i thought that they were the right person because the email i was basing my guess off of was dpaz@berkeley.edu (s.t. it seemed that since their first name started with d and their last name started with paz that there was a reasonable chance that the guess could have worked out from my perspective); aside from SNS and daniel pazo, two people responded -- peter nishinaga and justin pan
* Other professors and their TA's
  * Prof. Steel - contacted to request CIS document because TA Peyyam Tabrizian has made public many quizzes and homework assignments; they never responded (TA's are Appel, Manber, Tabrizian, Yuan, Lee, Nguyen, Agrawal, La Marche, Eng); contacted Fall 2013 TA's s.t. we are looking for CIS document; also, we contacted Fall 2011 TA's (i.e. Tsou, Tabrizian, Appel, Voellmer) for same reasons; we note that there is overlap with Tabrizian for two Steel semesters and both Tabrizian and Agrawal each responded once
  * Prof. Wodzicki -- mentioned typo regarding textbook in their syllabus; they did not respond
  * Prof. Paulin -- contacted one TA (i.e. Minseon Shin) to get quizzes, but we lack good CIS document; Shin responded
  * Prof. Agol -- contacted to clarify which textbook was used and they responded -- we ultimately didn't need their help because we were able to deduce the correct book based on names of chapters s.t. these associations were made public by Prof. Agol; contacted TA's for Fall 2011 (i.e. Zhou, Harrison-Shermoen, Forman, Froehle, Greegard, Berlekamp, Berwick-Evans, Allen, Wand)
  * Prof. Hutchings -- we already have CIS document from websites; we contacted one of his TA's s.t. we requested quizzes and likely did not get a response
  * Prof. Holtz -- planned on contacting their TA's to get homework problems (i.e. a syllabus) so that we can use publicly-available quizzes from Kyle Miller; we likely did not yet email any TA's yet
  * Math webmaster -- wrong textbook for a certain semester (i.e. Spring 2011) for Math 1A; got no response
  * CopyCentral -- do they still have reader from Fall 2007? the answer is no because it is from so long ago
  * reader editors -- do they have copies of older reader? contacted Justin Blanchard, Daniel Schepler, Xianghui Shi; these three people are referenced by our Math 1B reader; we also contact Prof. Ming Gu on advice of justin; got no responses from daniel and xianghui; did not get information about fall 2007 math 1a reader overall in the end
  * Prof. Haiman and Prof. Shin -- did not contact anyone to ask any questions; however, we may wish to regarding how topics were chosen for exams (and we may wish to also contact TA's for certain classes taught by these professors)

Physics 7B
* Prof. Lee -- asked a lot of questions; was not able to help very much, but referred us to two physics class coordinators and gave a topic list for the final from Fall 2009; he gave us a department grading policy; he gave us a syllabus document and homework document we already had; he gave us a syllabus for physics 7c spring 2014 that is probably not publicly available; we messaged their TA's as well; we asked lee for CIS document, grade break-down, final topic list for fall 2007 (as opposed to for fall 2009), and finally finals (for fall 2007 and fall 2009) and grade break-down (again) and weight for final (from fall 2009) and how topics were chosen for final for fall 2009 (though this is redundant given that they provided a document specifying the topics already) and how topics were chosen for two midterms (i.e. whether the midterms cover disjoint sections from textbook); also, we asked lee for chalkboard-and-CIS-document-related details and if it is possible a CIS document never existed even as many separate parts and whether a CIS document was handed out in class and confirm that for Fall 2009 that Elby textbook was required; we asked lee to confirm or refute details from a big list of details for the purpose of constructing a replacement (possibly "lite") CIS document; among other details, we provided to lee e.g. course website for physics 7b lee from fall 2007
* Birgeneau, Frano, Bordel, Corsini, Packard, Zettl, Huang, Liphardt, Lanzara, McKee, Aganagic -- asked birgeneau/frano TA's about office hours for birgeneau/frano (and only got a response from head TA daniel hogan), emailed birgeneau/frano about how topics were chosen for exams and got no response; for bordel, asked about how topics were chosen for final and got a response; for corsini, asked about how topics were chosen for final and got a response and also got a request to forward remedial work; we messaged packard asking for CIS document and got a response saying he does not have it but that we are free to use exams on the internet that are his; zettl we haven't messaged yet; huang we messaged asking for how topics were chosen for final and we got no response; liphardt we haven't messaged at all, but their course website for physics 7b fall 2007 could be useful for adding details for lee or huang from that same semester; lanzara's TA's we messaged at same time as for birgeneau/frano for fall 2015 -- this is for physics 7b; we messaged mckee asking for CIS document on assumption that it could be shared with lee for fall 2009 and they responded saying they could not find it and that the two likely didn't share CIS documents anyway; we were planning on messaging mckee TA's to ask for student names for their sections, but didn't do this yet (and likely will not later); we contacted two aganagic TA's to ask why they chose young instead of giancoli as textbook -- what we really wanted to know can be summarized in this way -- a masteringphysics code can be re-used for a later semester but only if you plan on using same textbook again
* TA Austin Hedeman regarding workbook -- asked him about if there has only been one edition of workbook between 2007 and 2019 and if it is correct that the workbook began to exist between summer 2007 and fall 2007; he said he would look into this (on 1/23/2020) and we should respond to him asking about his findings; in particular, we care if the same workbook is used in fall 2009 as in spring 2015 and spring 2008; we know for some class in spring 2020 that the same workbook is used as in fall 2009 via calling college bookstore and comparing ISBN's
* two physics class coordinators -- Sakima and Trujillo -- asked both via lee for CIS document, grade break-down, mentioned that I can be content with no new information and using placeholder for CIS document; when asking lee about CIS document, grade break-down, chalkboard-and-CIS-document-related details and whether CIS document never existed even as many separate parts and whether CIS document was handed out in class and to confirm that for Fall 2009 that Elby textbook was required and confirm/refute details from a big list of details for purpose of constructing a repalcement (possibly "lite") CIS document, we also let sakima/trujillo know
* Prof. Lee TA's -- there are many, many people of this kind that we have contacted
* miscellaneous people -- mistake of contacting sophie weber, response from daniel hogan, corsini requested that we send him remdial work details; TA steven weber responded saying they don't have CIS document for lee fall 2009; macklin responded
* miscellaneous details regarding sending documents to other people -- sent fall 2009 physics 7b partial collection of administrative documents to some mckee ta's, sakima/trujillo (i.e. physics class coordinators), lee, mckee; note that we have likely sent many other documents to other people that we have not mentioned (s.t. this may also be the case for classes other than physics 7b)

Physics 24
* Prof. Jacobsen -- requested CIS document but they were unable to find it

Who were our TA's for yellow classes?

CS 70
* Prof. Tse, Prof. Rao -- Rao responded and was unable to help and Tse did not respond
* TA Amir -- gave CIS documents and a lot more

Math 53
* Prof. Frenkel -- responded with CIS document

Physics 7A
* Prof. Lanzara -- use only archived course website; we contacted TA dmitri about CIS document, though we have one already via course website (noting that the idea is that even better than a website would be a PDF); we contacted TA tagliaferro on advice of dmitri and asked him for CIS document as well and did not get a response from him

Chem 3A/3AL -- have CIS document

Art Practice 98 -- have CIS document

Math 1B -- have physical copy of CIS document

Some future work -- back up files and websites and remove watermarks

Note that we got some responses via official school-related email account that we did not properly check before

## Sticky assumptions

### Class-response-related

Students taking Math 1A and Physics 7B quizzes in in discussion or DL sections (resp.) are given e.g. 15 minutes.

Sections from textbook chosen for midterms are disjoint and for final sections come from whole course with emphasis on those after most recent midterm. This pertains to Math 1A and Physics 7B, but sometimes we know parts of this for sure for certain classes (e.g. Zettl Spring 2008 Physics 7B probably based on course website and Lee Fall 2009 Physics 7B for final and partially for Haiman, Shin; also, we know this for Bordel final via email).

Workbook for Physics 7B between Fall 2007 and Spring 2020 (endpoints inclusive) were same. Specifically, we care about Fall 2009 and Spring 2008 and assume that same workbook being used means same worksheets and labs being used.

Reader for Math 1A in Fall 2007 is similar to publicly-available reader for Math 1A from present day (i.e. around early 2020).

Quizzes for Holtz Fall 2014 Math 1A according to TA Richard Zhang and TA Kyle Miller are allotted 15 minutes. We lack Zhang's quiz PDF's however as they were removed very close to when we were planning to back them up (i.e. within a month earlier than that date). At any rate, even if we got the PDF's, quiz eight was not released (assuming that there was one). If a tree falls in a forest and no-one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? There are likely countless other cases of quiz collections having been made that were not made public. So, it is not worth getting too agitated about missing quiz collections, even though this collection was effectively a near-hit.

We do not know for sure that we missed midterm #2 for Hald Fall 2007 Math 1A, but emails seem to suggest that we did; certain emails that we have from around the time of midterm #2 mention that the final ended up being worth more for myself, which via partial CIS document seems to suggest that we missed that midterm.

For our main choices for exams and quizzes for Math 1A and Physics 7B, we have at least shallow scoring systems (i.e. we have high-level scoring details but we have no information about how to assign partial credit). Exams that we consider as useful for Math 1A and Physics 7B generally have mention of how points are assigned to each problem (but not necessarily to subproblems). When it specifically comes to quizzes, for Math 1A we have quizzes from Fall 2008 that mention point values and for Physics 7B we make the quizzes ourselves anyway. When we use other exams or quizzes s.t. we lack official scoring system for them, we can then assume that we use scoring system of questions at same level on same exam or quiz being weighted equally.

While we may most likely be lax about grading for homework, labs, and worksheets, it is worth mentioning that original courses may have some special grading system for e.g. homework; for Physics 7B, homework was half-way done electronically. In the case of Physics 7B electronic homework, we may be hard-pressed to recover the exact scoring system.

For our replacement course for Physics 7B, we have instructions for performing labs (assuming same workbook is used in Zettl Spring 2008 and Lee Fall 2009). To actually perform the labs, we need to have equipment, which is harder to address. Thankfully, this is not as much of an issue for us specifically because we have already done the labs in Fall 2010 (assuming same workbook is used in Zettl Spring 2008 and Lee Fall 2009 and Ramesh Fall 2010).
