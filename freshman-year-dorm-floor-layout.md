#### Special colored shapes

A gray filled circle means a room is non-student-occupied.

Details we mention for when a shape is filled do not apply to aforementioned special colored shape.

#### Main colors

Green means we are 100% sure.  
Yellow means we are somewhat sure.  
Red means we are mostly not sure or have no out-right evidence for.  

#### Main shapes

Squares are for personal opinion.  
Triangles are for opinion of SO.  
Diamonds are for opinion of MH.  

#### Initials

As far as we know (i.e. ignoring mystery people), initials for each student are unique w.r.t. those for other students on the floor for academic year of interest.

#### Filled vs. outline

For student-occupied rooms, filled shapes are for that the grouping of students is accurate.  
For student-occupied rooms, outline shapes are for that the location of the room for the group is accurate.

For non-student-occupied rooms, filled shape means purpose of room is accurate.  
For non-student-occupied rooms, outline shape means location for room with certain purpose is accurate.

#### Room name order

Names of students within each room are sorted by last name.

#### Number footnotes

1. Don’t know if there were zero to two more people.
2. We know first name (that may be official or unofficial) of “A?”, but we don’t know last name.
3. Don't know official first name for SC; i.e. even though we know what first initial of "S" expands to, the actual first name could be completely different and not start with "S".

#### More details regarding information provided by others

SO (2018-03-20):  
* We know they likely were not wrong about who was in their own room; the rest of the details we treat as guesses.
* GJ, SO, A? are a group s.t. exiting elevator and looking down the hall they are at far end at right.
* Across was LDLC and FM.
* Next to their room was possibly SC, MH, CD.

MH (2018-03-28):  
* We know they likely were not wrong about who was in their own room; the rest of the details we treat as guesses.
* CD, MH, AP are a group.
* GJ, SO, A? are a group.
* SC and RW are together and TL may have been with them.

#### Remaining assumptions

##### Room kinds

We are assuming that for the floor for academic year of interest student-occupied rooms were either singles, doubles, or triples (i.e. there were no quads and of course rooms with even more than four people). This assumption is corroborated by descriptions of units one, two, and three from Cal housing website from around October 2007 via Internet Archive. However, we believe it's safe to assume that it's possible there may be exceptions.

##### Kinds of halls for units one and two

We note that for each of unit one and unit two, there are four non-apartment non-mini-suite buildings that have same layout. For unit one, these are Cheney, Deutsch, Freeborn, Putnam. For unit two, these are Cunningham, Davidson, Ehrman, Griffiths. (We again point out that unit two Cunningham Hall is one of these buildings.) For unit one, Christian and Slottman are mini-suite buildings. For unit two, Towle is a mini-suite building and Wada is an apartment building. We are assuming that each of these non-apartment non-mini-suite buildings across units one and two have the same design (i.e. both external and internal).

##### Kinds of halls for unit three

We note that unit three has four non-mid-rise buildings -- these are Ida Sproul, Norton, Priestly, Spens-Black. Also, there is one mid-rise building called Beverly Cleary.

##### Construction dates for units one through three

We note that unit one was built in 1959, unit two was built in 1960, and unit three was built in 1963.

##### Relationships between standard halls in units one and two and those in unit three

We assume that unit three is very similar to units one and two s.t. the four standard halls for unit three look similar to the standard halls for units one and two; however, while the standard halls for unit one and two are oriented the same way, for unit three some of the standard halls are mirrored along some standard axis. We assume that the standard halls for unit three each have same layout excepting for said possible mirroring and that otherwise the main differences are with regards to exterior superficial appearance.

##### Locations of indoor staircase, room 801, and elevator for Cunningham Hall

Given that we assume a similarity between standard halls in unit three with standard halls in units one and two and given that we assume for each of these standard halls in units one through three there is one outdoor staircase and one indoor staircase, we know from a video for unit three that the extra room from our diagram (for a floor that is not the ground floor) likely was not for one of two staircases. This is because in the video the staircase door has a window and in that video the door to the extra room has no window. We infer that next to the elevator doors (i.e. to left if exiting the elevator) is a door leading to an indoor staircase (as the outdoor staircase is on the other end of the hall). How close is the indoor staircase door to the elevator doors, then? We consider views from outside. Given that we assume an elevator shaft has no windows as elevator cars most likely did not have windows in them (i.e. we know elevator cars had no windows for the hall we stayed at in unit two, according to our memory), the column with a special window next to the bathroom windows has to be for the only possible remaining special room -- an indoor staircase. Further, based on a view from otuside, we know our student-occupied room (i.e. room 801) would be more distal (i.e. more towards east or given that trunk is along midway along axis traveling between east and west) than indoor staircase (i.e. the staircase near the elevator) -- this is also (mildly) corroborated by our memory.

##### Spatial anchor for diagram

Next, we are assuming that we treat our room (i.e. the one with ZL) as a spatial anchor; otherwise, we would not be able to treat that room and the room across the hall from it as having locations that are for sure.

##### Number of slots from east to west for each of north or south sides

Finally, we note that there are nine slots for rooms on each of north or south sides of the unit two standard hall we care about (i.e. Cunningham Hall, again). This is ignoring the outdoor staircase and the "extra room".

##### Outdoor staircase

It's important to note that there are photos of units one through three s.t. it is clear that for the end of the hall far away from that with the elevator (e.g. west side for Cunningham Hall) there is a door leading to an outdoor staircase. However, it seems to be the case that finding such photos can be difficult.

##### Assumption-related open questions

As an aside, given how much time has passed, it's not clear to us if opening the door to an outdoor staircase would have activated a fire alarm.
