## Big personal problems

1. Deleted emails in archive spanning 1997 to 2007
2. Locked T60p laptop hard-drive (for machine used starting in around summer of 2007 to around 2010 at latest)

(As can be observed, these problems may not necessarily be of interest to others. They may still be of practical concern for ourselves, however.)
